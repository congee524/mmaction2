For basic dataset information, please refer to the official [website](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades).
Before we start, please make sure that the directory is located at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/charades/`.

## Step 1. Prepare Annotations

First of all, you can download annotations to `$MMACTION2/data/charades/annotations` on the official [website](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades).

## Step 2. Prepare RGB Frames

Then, you can download RGB frames to `$MMACTION2/data/charades/rawframes` on the official [website](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades).

We only support training and testing with RGB frames now, but you can also download videos to `$MMACTION2/data/charades/videos`, or download optical flow to `$MMACTION2/data/charades/rawframes` on the official [website](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades).

## Step 3. Fetch File List

The file lists are generated by FAIR's [SlowFast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast).

Run the following scripts to fetch the file list for training and testing.

```shell
bash fetch_charades_filelist.sh
```

## Step 4. Folder Structure

After the whole data pipeline for Charades preparation.
you can get the RGB frames and annotation files for Charades.

In the context of the whole project (for Charades only), the folder structure will look like:

```
